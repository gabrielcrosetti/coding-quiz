## Summary

A start button for the coding quiz will appear once the page is loaded. Once start is clicked, the first of five multiple questions will appear on the screen, along with a timer that is counting down how much time is remaining. If a question is answered correctly, a notification that the answer was right will appear on the screen, and if a question is answered incorrectly, then a notification will notify the user and 7 seconds will be deducted from the timer. When the user completes the quiz, they will have the option to submit their initials and their score to a leaderboard.
